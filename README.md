## üìÇ Contents

1. **Algorithm for Logistic Regression (for understanding purpose)**  
   - Step-by-step implementation of the logistic regression algorithm.  
   - Covers concepts like the sigmoid function, cost function, and gradient descent.

2. **Practical Logistic Regression (using scikit-learn)**  
   - Demonstrates how to use `scikit-learn` to build logistic regression models.  
   - Includes training, prediction, and evaluation with metrics.
